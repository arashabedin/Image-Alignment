# Image-Alignment
Aligning the contents in an image together based on their similarity,according to their position and scale, using **Python** and **OpenCV**. This algorithm is not as fast ast the other image matching algorithm such as FAST and SIFT, but since it measures the similarity of the contents by the corners, it works perfectly with every edge detected images. The function alignImages takes two parameters: first parameter is original image and second parameter is the image is the image we want to align (relocate) its contents according to the original image. The function then returns the relocated image in the original resolution.
